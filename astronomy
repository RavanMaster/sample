    <p>Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects, phenomena, and processes
        outside of the Earth's atmosphere. It uses various branches of physics and mathematics to
        explain the origin and evolution of these celestial bodies and events. Astronomers study objects
        such as planets, moons, stars, galaxies, comets, and phenomena including supernovae, quasars,
        and cosmic microwave background radiation. The field is divided into observational and
        theoretical branches, with observational astronomy focused on acquiring data from
        observations, and theoretical astronomy concerned with developing models and simulations to
        describe astronomical objects and phenomena. Amateur astronomers play an active role in the
        field, particularly in the discovery and observation of transient events. The term "astronomy"
        comes from the Greek words for "star" and "law" or "culture," reflecting the ancient roots of the
        science.</p>

    <p class="scroll">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object
        known to harbor life. It is the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets in the Solar
        System, with a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers. Earth is composed of iron, oxygen, silicon,
        magnesium, sulfur, nickel, calcium, and aluminum. The majority of Earth's surface is covered
        in water, with the oceans holding about 96.5% of the planet's water. The remaining 3.5% is
        freshwater, with most of it being locked up in ice caps and glaciers. Earth has a liquid outer
        core that generates a magnetic field capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds
        and cosmic radiation. The planet's atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen and oxygen,
        with water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other gases making up the remainder. Earth has one
        natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits the planet at a distance of about 384,400 kilometers.
        The planet takes about 365.25 days to complete one orbit around the Sun, and rotates around its
        own axis in approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes.</p>
